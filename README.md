# app

> Firebase Test

## Commands

You can replace `yarn` with `npm run` here.

```bash
# build for production
yarn build

# development mode
yarn dev

# run unit tests
yarn test

# serve the bundled dist folder in production mode
yarn serve
```

## Polyfills

By default we only polyfill `window.Promise` and `Object.assign`. You can add more polyfills in `./src/polyfills.js`.

## Analyze bundle size

Run `yarn report` to get a report of bundle size which helps you:

- Realize what's really inside your bundle
- Find out what modules make up the most of it's size
- Find modules that got there by mistake
- Optimize it!

## Progress Web App

Your app is now offline-ready (only in production bundle), which means you can visit it without network.

Here we use a default [manifest.json](./static/manifest.json) to configurure your pwa, for example, to enable *Add to Home Screen* feature on Android. It will be copied directly to `./dist/manifest.json`.


For all the available options, please head to [poi-preset-offline](https://github.com/egoist/poi/tree/master/packages/poi-preset-offline#api).

## How this project was create

### 1. Create a *Dockerfile* and *docker-compose.yml* file

```
FROM node:12.10
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
```

```
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build: 
      context: .
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    command: bash
```

### 2. Build and run the container:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose run app bash
```

### 3. Install dependencies:

```
yarn init
yarn global add create-vue-app
```

### 4. Create the vue app:

```
cd ../
create-vue-app app
```

Answer the questions like so:

```

# 5. Update the *Dockerfile* and *docker-compose.yml* file:

FROM node:12.10

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

RUN yarn
RUN yarn build

CMD yarn start
```

```
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build:
